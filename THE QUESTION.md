THE QUESTION
Based on the syllabus provided in your screenshots, here is a comprehensive Java classwork assignment. It is designed to test everything from basic syntax (Tutorials 1-10) to control flow and complex data structures (Tutorials 11-24).

Java Programming Classwork: Comprehensive Review
Part 1: Basic Logic & User Interaction
Scenario: Create a program that acts as a simple Inventory & Pricing Tool for a small shop.

Input & Variables: Use a Scanner to ask the user for the name of a product, its current quantity in stock (integer), and its price per unit (double).

String Manipulation: Print a sentence that summarizes the input in all capital letters using a String method.

Math Operations: Calculate the total value of the stock for that item. Then, calculate what the price would be if a 15% discount were applied.

Part 2: Methods & Logic (The "Calculator" Logic)
Scenario: Create a specialized method for the shop's tax calculations.

Return Statements: Create a method named calculateTax. It should take a double (the total price) as an argument and return a double representing a 7% tax.

Comparisons: In your main program, use an if statement to check:

If the total value (after tax) is over $500, print "High Value Inventory."

Otherwise, print "Standard Value Inventory."

Part 3: Selection & Flow Control
Scenario: The user needs to select a shipping category.

Switch Statement: Ask the user to enter a shipping grade (A, B, or C).

A: Print "Overnight Shipping."

B: Print "2-Day Shipping."

C: Print "Standard Shipping."

Default: Print "Invalid Grade."

Part 4: Arrays & Loops
Scenario: Managing a list of daily sales figures.

Arrays & For Loops: Create an array of doubles that stores the sales for 5 consecutive days.

Use a for loop to calculate the sum of all sales in that array.

Print the final sum.

While Loops (The Guessing Game): Create a "Secret Code" (integer). Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess the code until they get it right.

2D Arrays & Nested Loops: * Create a 2D array representing a 3x3 grid of shelf locations (store strings like "Empty" or "Occupied").

Use nested for loops to print every location in the grid to the console in a table format.

Part 5: Exponents & Final Documentation
Exponent Method: Write a custom method that takes two integers: a base and an exponent. Use a for loop (not Math.pow) to calculate the result and return it.

Comments: Throughout your entire program, use both single-line and multi-line comments to explain the purpose of your methods and complex logic blocks.
